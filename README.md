## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @metrics/process
```

## Example

```js
const stream = require('stream');
const Process = require('@metrics/process');

const proc = new Process();

proc.pipe(new stream.Writable({
    objectMode: true,
    write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        console.log(chunk);
        callback();
    },
}));

proc.start();
```

## Description

This module collects different process and system metrics on a scheduled frequency. The module is
a readable stream which each metrics is emitted on as an metric object on each schedule.

The stream of metrics can be piped into ex the [@metrics/client](https://github.com/metrics-js/client)
or the [@metrics/emitter](https://github.com/metrics-js/emitter) for further distribution.

Example:

```js
const Process = require('@metrics/process');
const Client = require('@metrics/client');
const Emitter = require('@metrics/emitter');

const proc = new Process();
const client = new Client();
const emitter = new Emitter('udp', { port: 45000 });

proc.pipe(client).pipe(emitter);

proc.start();
```

Each metric is collected by a collector. Most collectors will provide metrics on each scheduled
run but some metrics will only run once due to its nature. Some metrics will not be collected on
some operating systems. Please see [collectors](#collectors) for further detail.

### On not staying alive

The internal scheduler is a defered interval which prevents kicking off the collection of a new
set of metrics before any previous collection of metrics has finished. This prevents duplicate
metrics and possible memory leaks if any of the async operations of collecting the metrics get
stale for some weird reason.

The scheduler is by default [unrefered](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/timers-in-node/) so
it will not hold up your node.js process.

## Constructor

Create a new Process instance.

```js
const Process = require('@metrics/process');
const proc = new Process(options);
```

### options (optional)

An Object containing misc configuration. The following values can be provided:

 * **interval** - `Number` - Time between each collection of process metrics in milliseconds. Default: 10000ms.
 * **prefix** - `String` - A prefix to be added to each metrics name.

### returns

Returns a Readable stream in object mode.

## API

The Process instance has the following API:

### .start()

Starts the scheduling of metric collection. The first run of metric collection will run immediately
upon calling this method.

### .stop()

Stops the scheduling of metric collection. Calling this method will not break the stream pipeline.

## Events

An instance of the object will emit the following events:

### drop

Emitted when the process is dropping metrics. Will emit the dropped metric.

_Example_

```js
const process = new Process();
process.on('drop', metric => {
    console.log('dropped metric', metric);
});
```

### collect:start

Emitted when the process starts collecting metrics.

_Example_

```js
const process = new Process();
process.on('collect:start', () => {
    console.log('Started collecting metrics');
});
process.start();
```

### collect:end

Emitted when the process is done collecting metrics.

_Example_

```js
const process = new Process();
process.on('collect:end', () => {
    console.log('Ended collecting metrics');
});
process.start();
```

## Attribution

Most of the metric collectors in this module originate in the process collectors in [prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client). prom-client is licensed under a Apache License 2.0, which
is included in our [license](https://github.com/metrics-js/process/blob/master/LICENSE).

Due to the above fact, most metrics in this module bear the same name as the process metrics in
prom-client. If one uses this module to provide metrics to Prometheus, these metrics will provide
the same metrics as by prom-client.
