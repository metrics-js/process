Module for collecting different process and system metrics providing them as a metric stream.

## Usage

- [Getting started with MetricsJS](https://metrics-js.github.io/introduction/getting-started/).
- [Reference documentaiton for `@metrics/process`](https://metrics-js.github.io/reference/process/).

## Attribution

Most of the metric collectors in this module originate in the process collectors in [prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client). prom-client is licensed under a Apache License 2.0, which
is included in our [license](https://github.com/metrics-js/process/blob/master/LICENSE).

Due to the above fact, most metrics in this module bear the same name as the process metrics in
prom-client. If one uses this module to provide metrics to Prometheus, these metrics will provide
the same metrics as by prom-client.
